## Journey

I've explored various programming languages over the years, each time learning something new along the way.

- I started with C and C++ for competitive programming. Around that time, Python 2 was still widely used, but Python 3 seemed more promising, so I spent some time getting familiar with it.

- When I wanted to build a personal website, I looked into popular technologies and ended up using Hexo, which introduced me to HTML & CSS. Later, as I wanted more customization, I learned JavaScript (with Node.js) and even built my own Hexo theme with some modifications to the Markdown rendering engine.

- Curious about modern web development, I experimented with frameworks like React, then Vue, and later Nuxt.js. On the backend, I started with Express & Koa (Node.js), then explored Gin (GoLang), and eventually Actix-web (Rust).

- I actually started learning AI early in university, taking related courses and working on projects using Python & PyTorch. While thereâ€™s still so much more to explore, AI has been a key part of my journey.

- Along the way, Iâ€™ve built many small projectsâ€”some finished, some abandonedâ€”mostly because my interests keep shifting, and maintaining everything isnâ€™t easy.

I wouldnâ€™t call myself an expert in any of these, but I enjoy learning and experimenting with new technologies! ðŸ˜Š
